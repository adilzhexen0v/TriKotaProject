            "ATPCO provides content, technology, standards, and governance throughout flight shopping. By using our Platform, Participant agrees to all terms and conditions and represents that it has the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms. If you do not agree to any of these terms, then you may not use the Platform. Likewise, by using our Platform, Participant authorizes ATPCO to collect and distribute the data on its behalf, either directly or via its agents (e.g., authorized partner airline, third-party service provider or any other authorized entity). In turn, ATPCO will store such data, calculate results from such data and distribute either or both in accordance with these Terms.  "

These standards are adopted and agreed to by the participating airlines and other parties engaged in the distribution and processing of airline pricing and retailing products (e.g., systems, channels and airline partners). These Standards govern the accurate collection, processing, distribution and interpretation of airline retailing content."

Participant may terminate platform use, by written notice given prior to the effective date of any increase in Pricing. Should Participant so terminate its use, ATPCO agrees, if so requested by Participant, to continue to use platform hereunder for a period of six (6) months from the effective date of the increase to which such termination is attributable, at one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Pricing in effect immediately prior to such increase. In the event Participant withdraws its notice of termination prior to the expiration of the six-month period, Participant shall retroactively pay the difference between the increased Pricing and the prior Pricing, plus ten percent (10%) thereof, for said six-month period."
